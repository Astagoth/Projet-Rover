# Project Rover by Orange

## Summarize

This project was given to us by our Highschool which was in partenariat with Orange to create an app that can control a Rover with a Surface Pro 2 running on Windows 10.

We did it in C# / .NET and WinForms in Microsoft IDE Visual Studio Community 2019.


## The Team

We were in a team of 4 students :

* Dudzinski Théo
* Gerzynski Gaetan
* Hadoux Benjamin
* Dufour Jordan

## Task planning

Each one of us were assigned with a specific task :

* Théo : In charge of choosing the sensors, coding them and integrate them in the rover
* Gaetan : In charge of the embedded system in the rover, sending sensors informations to the app, receiving app orders and sending them to the rotors of the rover
* Benjamin : In charge of the rotors which receive orders from the embedded system, translate orders to RS232 protocol
* Jordan : In charge of designing and coding of the app that the technician will use to control the rover, receive sensors informations and send orders to embedded system via TCP/IP protocol


## Note :

This project is not finished and only in prototype version, could not be finished due to the sudden appearance of COVID in march 2020, so teachers canceled all projects.
This project also include only my part of work (Dufour Jordan) so you will only find all the classes and code for the winforms app.
